Project announcements significantly outnumbered policy news. North Macedonia and Hungary showed little activity, suggesting need to explore local regulatory bulletins. Going forward, automating direct monitoring of energy ministry sites and PPA registries could improve coverage and reduce lag.</p> </footer>
